# 2025 Multi-party Dilemma Report

Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work:

- [x] remove some proper nouns from the source (prefer anonymity of participants for now)
- [ ] re-export the current draft as HTML
- [ ] commit it here as a starting point
- [ ] `tidy` the markup
- [ ] if `tidy` doesn't quite work, write some code to transform the markup
- [ ] push code to GitHub to get it published as a staging ground
