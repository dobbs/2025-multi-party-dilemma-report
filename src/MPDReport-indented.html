  <p class="c9"><span>Welcome! Thank you for being here. I know you
  all have busy schedules and could have chosen something else.
  Let’s do our best to reward everyone for making that choice. The
  first step is to set explicit ground rules for this
  retrospective. Our primary goal for this meeting is for each of
  us to discover new insights into the complexity of our
  continually changing business.</span> <span class="c2">It is of
  particular importance to suspend judgement about mistakes or
  errors and instead look closely for why those actions made sense
  in the context of the incident.</span><span>&nbsp;Let us agree at
  the outset that no one of us has a complete or correct
  understanding of how our whole system works. When things break,
  when we make mistakes, we have an opportunity to peek through
  those cracks to get a new glimpse into what’s really going on, to
  gain insights we can apply, both</span> <span class=
  "c22">individually</span><span>&nbsp;and</span> <span class=
  "c22">collectively</span><span>, to improve everything we
  do.</span> <span class="c1">There is so much more value to be
  mined from this experience than the conventional post-incident
  action items—please hold those ideas until the end after we have
  as much context as possible.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c12" id="h.s6eiq86bapmu"><span class=
  "c20">Narrative</span></h1>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c1">The day began with high
  expectations and anticipation of high traffic. A 50% off sale was
  intended to boost sales numbers which have been in a recent
  slump.</span></p>
  <p class="c5"></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Partial failure raised initial
  confusion: significant impact, but only in the EU during US
  business hours.</span></p>
  <p class="c5"></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Customer service was immediately
  overloaded.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We were completely
  caught off guard by the volume of customer complaints and unable
  to focus on effective communications because we didn’t understand
  what was happening. Many responders expressed surprise that we
  didn’t detect the problems before the flood of support
  calls.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Parallel
  investigations.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Initial symptoms
  were quickly confirmed to be focused in the EU. Investigations
  began seeking evidence in two broad areas: 1) infrastructure, and
  2) recent changes to various services. Load balancers were found
  to be working fine. The main symptom, an unbranded nginx 500
  error, indicated that networking and DNS were working
  correctly.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">An email notification in the spam
  folder.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The vendor running our data
  center had known problems with air conditioning that went
  unnoticed in our company because the message went to a spam
  folder.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Notable shift to focus on
  infrastructure.</span><span>&nbsp;The discovery of the email from
  the vendor catalyzed a significant and simultaneous shift in
  focus. Many responders independently turned their attention away
  from investigating recent changes.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Multiple support contracts.</span>
  <span class="c1">The initial outreach to the vendor revealed
  contractual terms of a 4 hour response time. Actual response time
  turned out to be much faster under the other contract, but there
  was significant distress in the moment.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Disruptive impact of executive
  attention.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;One of the incident
  commanders was almost completely consumed with the work of
  managing demands for information and updates for the CEO and
  CTO.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Were we fixated on changes to
  services?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As the focus shifted
  towards possible ways to mitigate, with the initial ambiguity
  becoming more clear, responders worried they had spent too much
  time investigating changes.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Intermittent
  recovery.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We reported recovery to
  our customers too quickly. There were initial signs of recovery,
  but they were not a complete solution.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Disagreement about business
  continuity plan (BCP).</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Once the
  mechanism of failure was narrowed down to loss of
  air-conditioning in the data center, there was significant
  disagreement about whether to await the repair or fail out of the
  data center.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Parallel
  interventions.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Amid the
  disagreement, incident commanders directed activity in two broad
  directions: communications to discover what to expect from the
  vendor, and taking steps toward failing out the datacenter. A key
  area of focus was making sense of the business continuity plan to
  understand the point of no return in that process and to do as
  much preparation as possible before taking that high-consequence
  action.</span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Uncomfortable
  success</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from engaging the BCP. In
  this case, the BCP proved successful in mitigating impact. But
  from previous drills of the BCP, we probably got
  lucky.</span></p>
  <h1 class="c12" id="h.gai63xifx18k"><span>Themes</span></h1>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c15">A theme is something observed
  from multiple points-of-view in the incident. It is a common area
  of interest from multiple participants. A theme is rich with
  potential for generating insight or discovery. Theme is an
  abstraction. We need examples to help understand the
  abstraction.</span></p>
  <p class="c5"></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c1">These themes have the most
  supporting evidence in this incident. They generated fruitful
  discussion in the retrospective.</span></p>
  <p class="c5"></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Saturation and
  overload.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Customer Service was
  overwhelmed. The incident commanders skillfully navigated their
  own and each other’s saturation.</span></p>
  <p class="c5"></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Expertise hides the difficulty of
  work.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;…</span></p>
  <p class="c5"></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Common ground supports
  coordination.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;…</span></p>

  <p class="c9"><span class="c2">Tradeoff
  decisions.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Disagreement about
  whether to await a fix of the air conditioning or activate the
  business continuity plan.</span></p>

  Saturation—and Four Responses to Overload</span></h2>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c22">Managing the risk of saturation
  (or the inverse, managing the capacity to
  adapt)</span><span class="c22">&nbsp;is a marker of expertise in
  resilience engineering. This case is the first time, Dear Reader,
  this analyst has had participants explicitly aware of managing
  saturation—their own or their colleague's.</span><sup class=
  "c22"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c15">There are four responses to
  overload (that is over-saturation). Two are urgent: reducing
  thoroughness, and shedding load. Two require anticipation:
  deferring work, and recruiting resources. Some examples
  follow.</span></p>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c15">It is worth noting that overload
  is everywhere. It’s in bacteria. It's in the way humans
  communicate. It's in our individual experience of a to-do list.
  It's in the kafka producers and consumers. It’s in our families
  and parenting. It’s everywhere. This model of responses to
  overload applies to any expression of overload.</span></p>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c15">The first two are the default
  ways that overload gets handled: reducing thoroughness on the
  collection of things you're trying to manage, or just dropping
  things from them getting done. What humans do by default is
  reduce thoroughness without even thinking. Before we even start
  shedding load, we reduce thoroughness and try as long as we can
  to manage the to-do list that's in our brain. At some point we
  just forget some of things we were trying to work on. That's
  where we drop load. But the default mode is reducing
  thoroughness. And these first two responses often come with
  sub-optimal outcomes.</span></p>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c15">The second two require
  anticipation of the bottleneck, but generally lead to better
  outcomes. You can recruit more resources, get help from other
  people, or other systems, or you can defer work until

  Service</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was immediately
  overloaded.</span></p>
  <p class="c13 c18"><span class="c2">in the
  retro<br></span><span class="c1">It is worth mentioning that as a
  business, we were completely caught off guard. Whenever customers
  notice a problem first, it means we are taken by surprise and
  immediately puts me and my team in a reactive position. We had 5
  instances in the past year.</span></p>
  <p class="c18 c13"><span class="c2">in slack during the
  incident</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;15:13:50.132Z<br>
  Sorry everyone i might not be too responsive getting overwhelmed
  here with these reports</span></p>
  <p class="c18 c13"><span class="c2">in the
  retro<br></span><span class="c1">Normally what happens is an
  incident is raised through internal mechanisms: alerting or
  someone notices it. This one began with a deluge of customer
  calls. “What happened?” “What is going on?” “What's happening to
  my order?” I didn't have anything internally looking wrong
  immediately.<br>
  <br>
  It threw me off because instead of putting up a status page, or
  managing customer calls, I was just trying to figure out what is
  happening, adding pressure on Incident Commander and Incident
  Deputy. What do I tell people? For me that was a difficult part
  in the beginning.</span></p>
  <p class="c18"><span class="c1">When the customer support person
  takes the extra moment to admit “i might not be too responsive,”
  they explicitly expects to be shedding load. Announcing that fact
  helps everyone else adjust their expectations accordingly—knowing
  about the overload, they might look for other channels for
  communications, or they will know they have to work harder to get
  through to customer support if it’s important.</span></p>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c1">When asked how the drill compared
  to their experience with real incidents, the Deputy Incident
  Commander immediately mentioned saturation:</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The moment that I felt like I was
  becoming quickly saturated, and I had things to do, it felt like
  an authentic incident because I felt like I was exercising those
  same muscles, the same skills and techniques as an incident to
  try to stay ahead of the tasks and keep from falling
  behind.</span></p>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Clarifying more
  specifically:</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c1">[The incident commander is] going
  to deputize me for certain roles that she needs me to do. And the
  very first thing she wanted me to do was to handle the business
  comms channel, because she was just far too busy to do that. And
  so that was my task.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But in addition to that task that
  she gave me, there was just an enormous amount of information to
  synthesize in a short amount of time. I had to get a gist of what
  was happening in the main channel that Incident Commander was
  dealing with before I left to focus my attention on the business
  comms channel.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That had a flood of information,
  and it had... even though these were simulated people, I still
  looked at them as real demands from stressed out people, because
  that's how they were conveyed to me.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c1">And in addition, Incident
  Commander was tasking me on telemetry from Grafana. Yeah. And I
  also had been checking in on the status of trying to reach the
  site and was able to reproduce the issue. And so that was on a
  polling loop in my mind as well.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I quickly have a kind of 4
  different trains of thought going right at the beginning of the
  incident, and I was already falling behind and feeling
  saturated.</span></p>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Another moment of the Deputy’s
  explicit awareness of saturation came up when asked for
  perspective about when the Incident Commander redirected focus
  from investigating changes to looking for infrastructure
  problems.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yeah, I think I'm too busy in the
  communications, and I don't know of it [the IC’s change of
  focus]. This was before [business continuity] plans were being
  looked at. I was still pretty saturated at that point.</span></p>
  <h2 class="c10 c25" id="h.n8glfk5apje9"><span class="c26">A
  high-pressure turning point, rich with insight.</span></h2>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c1">There is a particularly difficult
  moment when many pressures are bearing on the responders. The
  site has been showing errors to customers for over 15 minutes.
  They have learned that the mechanism of failure includes
  air-conditioning problems in the third party data center. They
  are still recovering from initial misunderstanding of an expected
  4 hour response time from the vendor. They are unsure if the
  business communications have gotten a message out to customers.
  An active debate is underway in the channel between the lead
  platform engineer and their manager about how to proceed. The
  Incident Commander and the Deputy are operating at saturation and
  yet they work with exceptional expertise, coordination, and
  common ground. It happens so quickly that it could easily be
  overlooked.</span></p>

  "c15">Deputy IC now reads the steps of the BCP for Incident
  Commander to internalize</span></p>
  <h2 class="c10 c25" id="h.xk9zp7595t2a"><span class=
  "c26">Expertise hides the difficulty of work (aka The Law of
  Fluency)</span></h2>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c1">At this moment, the Incident
  Commander has too much on her plate. She has already asked about
  the Business Continuity Plan about four different times in the
  slack channel—the only answer has been a link to the document
  which she does not have time to read. Here she is delegating the
  reading to the Deputy. But the way she delegates it is subtle and
  important:</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span class="c1">There's a BCP [Business
  Continuity Plan] doc.</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">She also shares her screen to
  show the deputy exactly which doc she means. This primes his
  perception to recognize the exact document and also subtly
  emphasizes the importance of the request.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span class="c2 c27">Do you have bandwidth to
  read it?</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">This is a critical bit of
  expertise about saturation and overload, and it is expertise on a
  couple different dimensions. She understands her own saturation
  and is explicitly recruiting resources—not shedding this load,
  not reducing thoroughness, but choosing one of the two more
  effective adaptations to overload. Yet she also understands that
  the Deputy is at risk of overload. She understands the BCP will
  demand some careful attention. Her question about bandwidth even
  precedes the specific request for help: “will you read this for
  me?”</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">With similar expertise, the
  deputy responds:</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yeah, once I get this CAN
  [Conditions-Actions-Needs report] out then I'll read it. I'm
  almost done.</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">He answers yes. This signals he
  understands the importance of the request. He defers the work
  momentarily, demonstrating awareness of his own saturation.
  Saying so out loud also signals his understanding that the BCP
  will demand careful attention. He also explicitly explains what
  he has prioritized ahead of this request to read the BCP. This
  both provides an update on her previous request, and also offers
  her a chance to override that prioritization decision.</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">The reciprocal exchange when the
  Deputy returns with the details about the BCP is similarly
  notable.</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">In the zoom recording, the
  Incident Commander is voicing and typing a complicated set of
  parallel questions to manage the parallel tracks and explicitly
  assigning people to respond to each question.</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">While that’s happening the Deputy
  is careful about how he interrupts. He knows how important the
  BCP is but he also recognizes that the incident commander is
  saturated with the questions she’s typing. He doesn't just drop
  it on her, but he does interrupt just enough to put himself at
  the top of her queue without blowing the cognitive stack that
  she's managing while typing those questions.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span>There are some execution steps for you
  in the BCP for failing over.</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">This is expert skill in
  coordination to have just the right amount of interruption. The
  Incident Commander replies with similar fluency to the earlier
  exchange.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span>Hold just a second while I get
  these...</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">Once again we can see explicit
  understanding of her own saturation and an explicit choice to
  defer the work. She also gives just enough signal to explain that
  the questions are taking priority and another moment to explain
  why they were important.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span class="c1">Sorry, I put you in a buffer.
  What was that about the BCP?</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span class="c1">The Incident Commander indicates
  she’s now ready for the details and also confirms her
  understanding that the interruption from the Deputy was about the
  BCP. The body language on the zoom recording is also notable. The
  Incident Commander closes her eyes and puts her head down,
  listening intently as the Deputy quickly reads through the
  details in the plan.</span></p>
  <p class="c16"><span>These very few words achieve enormous
  cognitive work and effective coordination. The fluency with which
  they are signaling awareness of, and carefully negotiating around
  each other's overload is extraordinary. It bears repeating that
  both incident commanders choose the more successful adaptations
  to overload. They both recruit each other as resources. They both
  defer work, if briefly. They also communicate just enough to keep
  the other aware of the state of their shared work.</span>
  <span>They mutually manage overload, that's really too much for
  both of them, and successfully cope with it.</span> <span class=
  "c2">They demonstrate expertise in managing adaptive
  capacity.</span></p>

  Software</span> <span>learns an emotional support practice from
  Medicine</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id=
  "cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></h3>
  <p class="c16"><span>During part 1 of the retrospective, the
  incident commanders were asked “How real does all of this feel?
  Hearing [the narrative] again, does this evoke what your brain
  and your body were going through at that
  time?”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id=
  "ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;A shallow
  interpretation of the incident commander’s answer is a simple
  “Yes. It’s realistic.” But in the answer given, we get a glimpse
  into a practice that we wouldn’t have even known to ask
  about.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span class="c1">I came off the incident so
  convinced that I'd run a real incident that I did a [90min]
  recording that night of a debrief of my own performance as IC,
  just to get it out of my head. Because even though my brain knew
  that this was a drill, my body still felt like I had gone through
  an incident. With my employer, we have this great debrief process
  that we use to help our incident commanders process through and
  regulate down so [they] don't go and stare at a wall at night and
  not sleep.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c28"></p>
  <h2 class="c23" id="h.9prz1e6y0d54"><span>Coordination is
  extremely demanding.</span> <sup><a href="#cmnt2" id=
  "cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span>Having a deputy helps.</span></h2>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c1">When prompted to reflect on the
  difficulty of that high-pressure turning point, the Incident
  Commander observed:</span></p>
  <p class="c13 c16"><span class="c1">Keep in mind there were two
  people here, not just one. … Even though we've never run an
  incident before, we have a really strong friendship and we have a
  lot of common ground.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span class="c1">There are two pieces to this.
  I know him. I know he knows how to handle saturation and monitor
  his own saturation. And I trust him. So I threw stuff at him
  knowing and trusting that he would prioritize the right things
  and offload or otherwise shed load however he needed to. … He is
  a very mature incident responder.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span class="c1">The second thing is that he
  and I have a strong friendship. We've written papers together,
  and traveled together, and all sorts of stuff. We come from
  similar incident response backgrounds. So I don't have to say a
  lot of the normal niceties that I would do with a person that I
  didn't know. I can be pretty terse. I need a CAN. I need this, I
  need that. Go, go, go.</span></p>
  <p class="c16 c13"><span class="c1">We share a language. So I'm
  not explaining what a CAN report is. I'm saying, “I need a CAN.”
  This basic stuff. Go! Put the CEO in a box. Go! I'm not
  explaining what it means to put an executive in a box. I'm not
  telling him how to do it. And I think that piece helps
  tremendously.</span></p>

  on what changed?</span></h2>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c15">Fixation is a common pattern in
  incident response, though not widely known in conventional
  incident retrospectives. Fixation is when responders fail to
  revise their assessments of the situation in light of new
  evidence. Cases of fixation include recurring behaviors,
  opportunities to revise, and an eventual recognition by
  participants that they have been stuck on the wrong thing.
  Interestingly, in this specific case, participants express
  knowledge of the pattern and some concern that they may have been
  fixated on investigating what changed—but they may not have
  actually been fixated. We present evidence that might support
  fixation and invite discussion.</span></p>
  <p class="c5"></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c1">The incident commander's first
  thought was about infrastructure. In this case that turned out to
  be well calibrated to the actual mechanism of failure. However,
  the response team fixated on reviewing recent changes for a few
  minutes before turning attention back to
  infrastructure.</span></p>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c1">The first indication of problems
  was an urgent message:</span></p>

  seems to be down. I've never seen anything like this</span></p>

  failing." They're not telling me something that tells me it's
